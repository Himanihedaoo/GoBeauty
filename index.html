            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Understanding Cosmetic Labels</p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Being familiar with the product you are using is important. Be sure to
                read the entire label, including the list of ingredients, warnings, and tips on how to use the product
                safely. Also, be aware of the following terms that you may see on the label:

                Hypoallergenic: Do not assume that the product will not cause allergic reactions. FDA does not define
                “hypoallergenic.”
                Organic or Natural: The source of the ingredients does not determine how safe it is. Do not assume that
                these products are safer than products made with ingredients from other sources. The U.S. Department of
                Agriculture (USDA) defines what it means for cosmetics to be labeled “organic.” However, there is no
                formal USDA or FDA definition for “natural.”
                Expiration Dates: The law does not require cosmetics to have an expiration date. However, a cosmetic
                product may go bad if you store it the wrong way — for example, in a place that is too warm or too
                moist. Marking the container with the date you open a cosmetic may help you keep track of the age of
                your cosmetics.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Stunning Beauty and Cosmetic Elements</p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Cosmetics are constituted from a mixture of chemical compounds derived
                from either natural sources, or synthetically created ones. Cosmetics designed for skin care can be
                used to cleanse, exfoliate and protect the skin, as well as replenishing it, through the use of
                cleansers, toners, serums, moisturizers, and balms. Cosmetics designed for more general personal care,
                such as shampoo and body wash, can be used to cleanse the body. Cosmetics designed to enhance one's
                appearance (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features (such as the
                eyebrows and eyelashes), add color to a person's face and, in the case of more extreme forms of makeup
                used for performances, fashion shows and people in costume, can be used to change the appearance of the
                face entirely to resemble a different person, creature or object. Cosmetics can also be designed to add
                fragrance to the body.

                Though the legal definition of cosmetics in most countries is broader, in some Western countries,
                cosmetics are commonly taken to mean only makeup products, such as lipstick, mascara, eye shadow,
                foundation, blush, highlighter, bronzer, and several other product types. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Skin is one of the largest organs of the body. Because of this, caring
                for your skin can directly affect your overall health. Your skin acts as a protective shield and is most
                vulnerable to outside elements. It’s affected by more factors than you may think.ompetition in the beauty industry is fierce. Cosmetics branding is the key to help you make your beauty brand stand out from the crowd—if you do it right.

                In order to succeed, you need to break through the clutter, grab your ideal customer’s attention and show them why your product is the one they need.</p>
